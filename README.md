## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS (SASS)
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to implement an accordion feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helped me understand how to manage hidden content and toggle between visibility states dynamically.

### Continued development

For future improvements, I would like to:

- Add more questions and answers dynamically from a JSON file or API.
- Implement a dark/light mode toggle.
